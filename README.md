# FasterCalculator

GeoTools-based Java program to perform bulk GIS raster calculations without any clipping

Called from the command line:
`java -jar fastercalculator [radius] [input directory] [output file *.tif]`

Whilst it works, there is a lot of work to do in terms of user-friendliness, so watch this space!
